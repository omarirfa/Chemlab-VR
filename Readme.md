# Chemlab VR

This is a project I worked on as my capstone or also known as a senior design project (SDP) during my bachelors. It was divided into two phases: SDP I and SDP II. 

SDP I is the proposal phase of what the individuals would like to work on, goals they are trying to acheieve with the project, expenditure costs, project management and ethical regulations.

While, SDP II was the implementation of the project. SDP I and SDP II folders contain documentation for both phases of the project.
